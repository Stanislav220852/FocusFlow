🌀 FocusFlow — Your Flow, Powered by Us
FocusFlow is an interactive co-working platform designed to turn solitary procrastination into an engaging, team-driven experience. We’ve combined the time-tested Pomodoro technique with powerful social mechanics to make productivity feel less like a chore and more like a "Hero's Journey."

🔥 What Makes FocusFlow Special?

🌐 Real-Time Synchronization
Forget about working in isolation. In every room, the timer is synchronized for everyone. You see the same countdown as hundreds of others. This "collective presence" effect triggers a psychological boost—when you see others in the flow, staying focused becomes natural.

🤫 "Absolute Silence" Mode
We protect your focus at all costs. As soon as the work phase begins, the room chat is automatically locked. No distractions, no notifications—just you and your task. The chat comes alive only during breaks, creating a perfect balance between deep work and social interaction.

🏆 Gamified Growth
Every minute of concentration earns you Experience Points (XP). Level up, unlock new ranks, and maintain your "Daily Streaks." Become a "Flow Master" and prove your discipline to yourself and the community.

🏠 Spaces for Every Goal
Choose from dozens of public halls (e.g., "Python Library", "Exam Prep", "Design Studio") or create private rooms for your friends and colleagues. Customize timers to fit your needs: from the classic 25/5 to deep-work sessions like 50/10.

📈 Personal Analytics
Track your progress in detail. FocusFlow saves the history of your victories over laziness, providing insightful charts of your productivity over weeks and months.

🛠 How It Works
Select a Room: Join a community of like-minded people or create your own private space.
Enter the Flow: When the timer starts, the chat freezes. It’s time to work.
Rest Together: The gong sounds—and the chat opens! Share insights, post helpful links, or just hang out.
Level Up: Your profile reflects your persistence. Accumulate XP and unlock new achievements.
